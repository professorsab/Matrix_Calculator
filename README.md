# Matrix_Calculator
This repository contains a Matrix Calculator implemented in C++ as a part of my first-semester project. The calculator supports various matrix operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and more. It also includes the use of pointer functions (PF) to handle dynamic memory allocation for matrix operations efficiently.
